## What to install?

### Simple

If you would like to quickly get up and running to start working on your automation projects than you are going to want to install just the [**Client Service**](client-service.md). This option installs the service that will connect to our Cloud Hosted solution and allows you to create and modify your graphs on [**Nodegem**](https://www.nodegem.io).

{% page-ref page="client-service.md" %}

### Advanced

If you don't feel comfortable hosting your automation solutions on the cloud then there is a solution for you too. You will still need to install the [**Client Service**](client-service.md) but you will also need to install the [**Web Client**](web-client.md) and [**Web API**](web-api.md) too. This way you will be able to host everything locally and make configurations that suit your needs. It will be up to you to figure out how to make the website public for yourself but we will try to make everything else as easy possible to setup.

## Additional Info

The **Quick Deploy** options are mostly free. **Heroku** and **Netlify** both offer free tiers which should be set by default. **Linode** is not free BUT it does have a very cheap tier of $5/month.
