# âš¡ Macros

## What is it?

Macros are similar to graphs in that they can be executed from the Sandbox view from the web client. Their purpose is to encapsulate logic that you plan on reusing. Similar to functions in most programming languages, they can be called many times and be recursive. In the future, we plan on implementing a **Macro Marketplace** which allows users to share their macros with others and build off each other.
