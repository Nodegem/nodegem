# ðŸ’¬ FAQ

### Why did you make this?

Honestly, I just wanted a project to work on and visual programming was always an interesting subject for me. I wanted to see if I could write something that could work on the web and be easy enough to use that even non-technical people could use.

### Why do you say this is "for everyone"?

I believe this tool can and should be easy enough for non-programmers to use. Every node, port, and macro will be properly documented and easy enough for everyone to understand. \(at least to the best of our abilities\) Everyone has something they wish to be automated but lack the knowledge, will, or time to find out ways to do so. This tool should be approachable enough for those people and provide the proper tooling to accomplish their needs.

### What can this be used for?

Currently this tool is very limited because I've only implemented the bare bones to show a proof-of-concept but I know with enough time and hopefully enough community effort, this tool can be used for many things like home automation, data science, web scraping, or even a stock trading bot! The foundation is there and I want to continue developing this project and hear the community's feedback on the project.

### Visual programming will never replace written code so why did you spend so much time making this?

I 100% agree that visual programming will never replace LOW LEVEL coding. I just don't believe that's in the cards but I do believe visual programming can be a very useful tool for the uninitiated and even the experienced developer who quickly want to make tools without having to setup a new project or script.

### Can this be used to create desktop apps, web apps, and/or mobile apps?

No, unfortunately this tool isn't THAT cool. I don't think there is even a way to make that possible even if I wanted to the tool to do that. This tool is a scripting tool that can automate certain parts of your life that you think can be automated, not a general purpose programming language. If you want to be able to create things like that you can take a look at .NET Core, Python, C++, etc.

### Why does your grammar suck?

Ehh, I was never that good at English class and honestly just don't care enough.
