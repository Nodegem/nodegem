[Nodegem](https://www.nodegem.io/) is a **visual scripting tool** meant for all kinds of automation projects without the need to know how to program. It is designed to be as inviting as possible to any and all kinds of people varying from no knowledge of programming to expert programmers. The plan is to have all sorts of integrations from many different sources and to be community driven.
